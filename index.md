## Welcome to My First Website

I was told to create a website via Aaron Stannard over something that was important to me. He said it could be pics of my puppies or the kiddos or whatever. 

I thought on that one a while and was really stuck on what to do my personal website over. I was really nervous about creating a website and was worried over how badly I was going to mess it up. My last phone call with my boss was one of the most inspirational. He stated don't just sit and worry about failing or not. Just do it. No YouTube videos for hours on end. No spirling down into the blackhole of never ending research - just take action. Even if it sucks. 

So I did. By far one of the most importanat things to me in this world - my sobriety. I doubt that is what he intended for me to write about ha ha ha but when it comes down to it, without my sobriety, I wouldn't have the life that I have today. I wouldn't be alive at all for that matter. So my sobriety is the topic to this website.

My sobriety date. The day I hit rock bottom. The day where life as I knew it ended and I truly started to live.
