## Welcome to My First Website

I was told to create a website via Aaron Stannard over something that was important to me. He said it could be pics of my puppies or the kiddos or whatever. 

I thought on that one a while and was really stuck on what to do my personal website over. I was really nervous about creating a website and was worried over how badly I was going to mess it up. My last phone call with my boss was one of the most inspirational. He stated don't just sit and worry about failing or not. Just do it. No YouTube videos for hours on end. No spirling down into the blackhole of never ending research - just take action. Even if it sucks. 

So I did. By far one of the most important things to me in this world - my sobriety. I doubt that is what he intended for me to write about ha ha ha but when it comes down to it, without my sobriety, I wouldn't have the life that I have today. I wouldn't be alive at all for that matter. So my sobriety is the topic to this website. 

### November 25, 2012
Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to
sanity.
My sobriety date. The day I hit rock bottom. The day where life as I knew it ended and I truly started to live. 


# Getting Sober
## Just Doing It - All 12 Steps
### Passing It On 

- The 12 Steps to Alcoholics Anonymous

1. We admitted we were powerless over alcoholâ€”that our lives had become unmanageable.
2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.
4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.
7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.
8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.
9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.
10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.
11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.
12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

The AA program is simple, but it's the hardest thing you will ever do. For the first time in a long time - you will have to be honest. Completely honest - with yourself. When you first walk in the rooms of AA you are told to sit down, take the cotton out of your ears and shove it in your mouth. What is the reason for this? We already know what you're going through. We have all been there in some shape, manner, or form. We offer a solution to the problems you walk in with. Kinda hard to get a solution if all you want to do is cover your ears and talk over everyone. Honey - we are all quite aware of what hell looks like. Would you like to know how we got out of it?
